# Practice project from Freshcode: Fullstack web application

## What the project does

This project consists of the following parts:

- **frontend** (a.k.a. client),
- **backend** (a.k.a. server), and
- **databases** (both SQL and NO-SQL).

It utilizes *Docker* compose to combine these individual parts together.

Client serves single-page application, written using *React* library/framework. Navigation between pages is powered using `react-router-dom` dependency. Frontend also makes use of *SASS*, the CSS preprocessor. Client can send requests to server to load data present in database(s). Additionally, client's codebase is written in *Typescript*, a superset of Javascript that allows writing type-safe code and can be incrementally adopted. Frontend uses *Babel* under the hood to transpile JSX and TS code into JS.

Server is run in *Node.js* runtime environment. Node.js allows running JS files as individual scripts and, for the current project, it allows us to create server to process requests from the client, interact with database(s) and send responses. Just like frontend, backend makes use of *Typescript*. Likewise, it utilizes *Babel* to transpile written Typescript code into Javascript.

Lastly, this project uses *PostgreSQL* as relational database and *MongoDB* as a non-relational database. However, due to project's migration to SQL usage of the NO-SQL database is marked as deprecated. Overall, the databases are used to store data about registered users, their contests, messages and much more. In relational databases, relations between tables are referenced via foreign keys. Such relations are also possible in non-relational databases. However, non-relational DBs allow more complex database structures to be implemented more easily.

In general, this web application demonstrates skills I have obtained while studying fullstack JS programming. In this project work has been done in separate git branches, ultimately merging them into a single one. `dev` branch contains code in its original state. Other branches contain changes made by me, starting with `bugfix` branch, which stems from the `dev` branch. All other commits are based on the `bugfix` branch, since major part of coding was done there, partially due to migration to Typescript.

## How to get started using the project

### Docker *(recommended)*

Running the project in Docker container environment is simple. Assuming you have Docker installed, all you need is:

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/U3erKa/fe2022-1-practice-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd fe2022-1-practice-project
```

3. Copy file with environment variables for server:

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

4. *(Optional)* Edit the `.env` file in your favourite text editor.
5. Ensure that startup script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x start-dev.sh
```

6. Run the script:

```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

And then wait until the required containers are created. This will take a while.\
*Note: `start.sh` is meant for production environment. To run project locally use `start-dev.sh` instead.*

When containers are built, they can be accessed via the following links:

- client: `http://localhost:5000`
- server: `http://localhost:3000`
- PostgreSQL database: `http://localhost:5432`
- MongoDB database: `http://localhost:27017`

### Node.js

Both client and server can be run from Node.js outside Docker containers. However, you need to have PostgreSQL and MongoDB installed. Additionally, client requires Node.js v16.x, whereas server can be run using either Node.js v16.x, v18.x or v20.x. With that in mind, here's how to get the project up and running:

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/U3erKa/fe2022-1-practice-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd fe2022-1-practice-project
```

3. Copy file with environment variables for server:

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

4. *(Optional)* Edit the `.env` file in your favourite text editor.
5. Navigate to client subdirectory:

```bash
cd client
```

6. Install Node.js dependencies for client:

```bash
npm i
```

7. Navigate to server subdirectory:

```bash
cd ../server
```

8. Install Node.js dependencies for server:

```bash
npm i
```

9. Edit `mongoConfig.json` and `postgresConfig.json` inside `config` folder on the server by changing "host" field to "localhost":

```diff
{
  "development": {
    /* ... */
-    "host": "db-dev",
+    "host": "localhost",
    /* ... */
  },
  /* ... */
}
```

10. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

*Note: it is important that the server runs on port `3000` to be accesible for the client. For that we start the server before the client*

11. In another terminal navigate back to client subdirectory:

```bash
cd ../client
```

12. Start the client:

```bash
npm start
```

*Note: You should receive the following prompt: `Would you like to run the app on another port instead? â€º (Y/n)`. Press `Y` or `Enter` to proceed.*

Assuming you have done everything correctly, web app can be accessed via the following links:

- client: `http://localhost:3001`
- server: `http://localhost:3000`
- PostgreSQL database: `http://localhost:5432`
- MongoDB database: `http://localhost:27017`
